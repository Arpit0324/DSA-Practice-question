// Q) Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

//A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

//Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

//Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words.
//Do not include any extra spaces.

    string reverseWords(string s) {
	
	//we make an answer string, that we have to return
        string ans = "";
