//We firstly need to assign vertical and level to every node.
//After we complete the assigning part then we need to figure out how can we store them in a suitable Data Structure.
//The data structure should give us the nodes with left-side vertical first and in every vertical, top-level node should appear first.
//Visualization of how the vertical lines passing through the nodes will look like:
//image
//Approach:

//We will perform a tree traversal and assign a vertical and level to every node.
//Based on this vertical and node, we store the node in our special data structure that we are gonna create.
//For easy understanding, let's break it into three steps:
//Step-1: Vertical and Level Assign to every node:

//We are going to use level order traversal, initially we will push the root in the queue and also two more variables one for vertical and the other for level, both intialized with 0.
//Whenever we push the left child we are going to decrease the vertical by one and increase level by 1 and in the case of right child we are going to increase both the vertical and level both by 1.
//Step-2: Storing Verticals and Levels to our Data Structure:

//We require a data structure that can store nodes according to their vertical value and give us the nodes of least values first.
//Hence we will use a map as it satisfies both criterias.
//Lastly for every level, we need a data-structure which can store node values in a sorted order.
//Moreover, as duplicate values are allowed in our tree, our data structure needs to handle this well. This is acheived by using multiset in C++
//How the data structure will look like --> map<int,map<int,multiset>> mp;
//Step-3: Finally just print the vertical order traversal from the data structure that we have built:

//Just iterate over our verticals by using the data structure that we created.
//In every iteration, we take a list(to store all nodes of that vertical) and again iterate over the levels. We then push the nodes of the level (stored in the multiset/priority queue) and push it to our vertical list.
//Once we iterate over all verticals we get our vertical order traversal.
